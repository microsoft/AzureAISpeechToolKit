# Azure AI Speech Toolkit for Visual Studio Code

The Azure AI Speech Toolkit helps developers explore *[Azure AI Speech Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/ai-speech/) and run quick-starts and scenario use cases with "simple clicks".

\!\[feature X\]\(images/feature-x.png\)

The Speech service provides speech to text and text to speech capabilities with a Speech resource. You can transcribe speech to text with high accuracy, produce natural-sounding text to speech voices, translate spoken audio, and use speaker recognition during conversations.

- **Real-time speech to text**: With real-time speech to text, the audio is transcribed as speech is recognized from a microphone or file. Use real-time speech to text for applications that need to transcribe audio in real-time.

- **Fast transcription**: Fast transcription is used to transcribe audio files with returning results synchronously and much faster than real-time audio. Use fast transcription in the scenarios that you need the transcript of an audio recording as quickly as possible with predictable latency.

- **Batch transcription**: Batch transcription is used to transcribe a large amount of audio in storage. You can point to audio files with a shared access signature (SAS) URI and asynchronously receive transcription results. Use batch transcription for applications that need to transcribe audio in bulk.

- **Text to speech**: With text to speech, you can convert input text into human like synthesized speech. Use neural voices, which are human like voices powered by deep neural networks. Use the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) to fine-tune the pitch, pronunciation, speaking rate, volume, and more.

- **Speech translation**: Speech translation enables real-time, multilingual translation of speech to your applications, tools, and devices. Use this feature for speech to speech and speech to text translation.

- **Language identification**: Language identification is used to identify languages spoken in audio when compared against a list of supported languages. Use language identification by itself, with speech to text recognition, or with speech translation.
